    "Sugarcane" => [
        "description" => "Sugarcane or sugar cane is a species of tall, perennial grass (in the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae) that is used for sugar production. The plants are 2–6 m (6–20 ft) tall with stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in sucrose,[1] which accumulates in the stalk internodes. Sugarcanes belong to the grass family, Poaceae, an economically important flowering plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops. It is native to New Guinea.[2]
Sugarcane was an ancient crop of the Austronesian and Papuan people. The best evidence available today points to the New Guinea area as the site of the original domestication of Saccharum officinarum.[3] It was introduced to Polynesia, Island Melanesia, and Madagascar in prehistoric times via Austronesian sailors. It was also introduced by Austronesian sailors to India and then to Southern China by 500 BC, via trade. The Persians and Greeks encountered the famous reeds that produce honey without bees in India between the sixth and fourth centuries BC. They adopted and then spread sugarcane agriculture.[4] By the eighth century, sugar was considered a luxurious and expensive spice from India, and merchant trading spread its use across the Mediterranean and North Africa. In the 18th century, sugarcane plantations began in the Caribbean, South American, Indian Ocean, and Pacific island nations. The need for sugar crop laborers became a major driver of large migrations, some people voluntarily accepting indentured servitude[5] and others forcibly imported as slaves.[6]

Grown in tropical and subtropical regions, sugarcane is the world's largest crop by production quantity, totalling 1.9 billion tonnes in 2020, with Brazil accounting for 40% of the world total. Sugarcane accounts for 79% of sugar produced globally (most of the rest is made from sugar beets). About 70% of the sugar produced comes from Saccharum officinarum and its hybrids.[7] All sugarcane species can interbreed, and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids.[8]

White sugar is produced from sugarcane in specialized mill factories. Sugarcane reeds are used to make pens, mats, screens, and thatch. The young, unexpanded flower head of Saccharum edule (duruka) is eaten raw, steamed, or toasted, and prepared in various ways in Southeast Asia, such as certain island communities of Indonesia as well as in Oceanic countries like Fiji.[9] The direct use of sugar cane to produce ethanol for biofuel is projected to potentially surpass the production of white sugar as an end product.",

    "Cotton" => [
        "description" => "Cotton (from Arabic qutn), first recorded in ancient India, is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. The fiber is almost pure cellulose, and can contain minor percentages of waxes, fats, pectins, and water. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.

The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.[1] Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds.[2]

The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable, and durable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BC have been found in the Indus Valley civilization, as well as fabric remnants dated back to 4200 BC in Peru. Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production and led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.

Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes or 110 million bales annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world's arable land. India is the world's largest producer of cotton. The United States has been the largest exporter for many years.",

        Given proper care and growing conditions, coconut palms produce their first fruit in six to ten years, taking 15 to 20 years
         to reach peak production.
True-to-type dwarf varieties of Pacific coconuts have been cultivated by the Austronesian peoples since ancient times. 
These varieties were selected for slower growth, sweeter coconut water, and often brightly colored fruits. 
Many modern varieties are also grown, including the Maypan, King, and Macapuno. These vary by the taste of the coconut water and color
 of the fruit, as well as other genetic factors..",

        "description" => "The cashew tree is large and evergreen, growing to 14 metres (46 feet) tall, with a short, often irregularly
         shaped trunk.[2] The leaves are spirally arranged, leathery textured, elliptic to obovate, 4–22 centimetres 
         (1+1⁄2–8+3⁄4 inches) long and 2–15 cm (3⁄4–6 in) broad, with smooth margins. The flowers are produced in a panicle or 
         corymb up to 26 cm (10 in) long; each flower is small, pale green at first, then turning reddish, with five slender, 
         acute petals 7–15 millimeters (1⁄4–5⁄8 in) long. The largest cashew tree in the world covers an area around 7,500 m2 
         (81,000 sq ft) and is located in Natal, Brazil.[citation needed]

The fruit of the cashew tree is an accessory fruit (sometimes called a pseudocarp or false fruit). What appears to be the fruit is an oval or pear-shaped structure, a hypocarpium, that develops from the pedicel and the receptacle of the cashew flower.  Called the cashew apple, better known in Central America as marañón, it ripens into a yellow or red structure about 5–11 cm (2–4+1⁄4 in) long.

The true fruit of the cashew tree is a kidney-shaped or boxing glove-shaped drupe that grows at the end of the cashew apple.
 The drupe first develops on the tree and then the pedicel expands to become the cashew apple.The drupe becomes the true fruit, 
 a single shell-encased seed, which is often considered a nut in the culinary sense.The seed is surrounded by a double-shell that 
 contains an allergenic phenolic resin, anacardic acid - which is a potent skin irritant  chemically related to the better-known and
  also toxic allergenic oil urushiol, which is found in the related poison ivy and lacquer tree.",
